## Structure

### Blog

- Article directory: [src/posts/](src/posts/)
- Article images: [public/images/posts/](public/images/posts/)

The header format for Markdown files is as follows:

```markdown
---
title: My Four Years of Frontend Career, Obsession with Search Engines
tags: Essay
date: 2024-9-25  
img: /images/posts/2024-09-25/inSearch-webui.jpg
describe: From Gleandu to inSearch, my four years of frontend career have always been obsessed with search engines.
language: en
---
```

Chinese articles may not be classified as `language`, but English articles must be classified as `language: en`.

### Homepage Personal Profile

Bilingual support is available, configured using JSON files:

- Chinese: [src/locales/cn.json](src/locales/cn.json)
- English: [src/locales/en.json](src/locales/en.json)

These files contain other i18n configurations. To update your personal profile, you only need to modify the `name`, `bio`, and `blogtitle` fields.

### About

The About page is edited in Markdown and supports both Chinese and English:

- Chinese: [src/content/cn/about.md](src/content/cn/about.md)
- English: [src/content/en/about.md](src/content/en/about.md)

You can also change the banner image for the About page: [public/images/about-banner.jpg](public/images/about-banner.jpg)

### Friends

The Friends page is written in JSON format within a TSX file: [src/pages/friends.tsx](src/pages/friends.tsx). It also supports multiple languages. The format is as follows:

```json
[
    {
      "name": "Rene Wang",
      "avatar": "/images/friends/ReneWang.png",
      "description": {
        "cn": "全栈开发大佬，天才少年，...",
        "en": "Full-stack developer, genius, ..."
      },
      "link": "https://rene.wang"
    },
    {
      "name": "Charles Su",
      "avatar": "/images/friends/CharlesSu.jpg",
      "description": {
        "cn": "乐于折腾，擅长刷机、黑苹果...",
        "en": "Tech enthusiast, expert in custom ROMs, Hackintosh..."
      },
      "link": "https://charles.su"
    },
    {

      },
      "link": "https://ygeeker.com"

```
