### Blog

The Markdown header format is as follows:

```markdown
---
title: My Four Years of Frontend Career, Obsession with Search Engines
tags: Essay
date: 2024-9-25  
img: /images/posts/2024-09-25/inSearch-webui.jpg
describe: From Gleandu to inSearch, my four years of frontend career have always been obsessed with search engines.
language: en
---
```

Chinese articles don't need to fill in `language`, but English articles must specify `language:en` to be properly categorized.

### Homepage Personal Profile

Supports bilingual configuration using JSON files:

- Chinese: [src/locales/cn.json](src/locales/cn.json)
- English: [src/locales/en.json](src/locales/en.json)

These files contain other i18n configurations; for personal profile, only modify `name`, `bio`, and `blogtitle`.

### About

The About page includes the following features:
- Personal profile
- Social media statistics (supports Twitter, Xiaohongshu, etc.)
- Image gallery (supports carousel and preview)
- Message board functionality

Configuration file locations:
- Chinese: [src/content/cn/about.md](src/content/cn/about.md)
- English: [src/content/en/about.md](src/content/en/about.md)

Social media configuration is set in `src/lib/social.ts`.

### Friend Links

Friend links are written in JSON within TSX: [src/pages/friends.tsx](src/pages/friends.tsx), also supporting multiple languages. Format as follows:

```json
[
    {
      "name": "Rene Wang",
      "avatar": "/images/friends/ReneWang.png",
      "description": {
        "cn": "Full-stack development expert, young genius, ...",
        "en": "Full-stack developer, genius, ..."
      },
      "link": "https://rene.wang"
    }
]
```

- Automatic generation of sitemap.xml and robots.txt
- Complete Open Graph and Twitter Card support
- Structured data (Schema.org) support
- Multilingual SEO optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
