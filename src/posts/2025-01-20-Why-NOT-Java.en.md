Recently, I've seen heated debates on social media about "why so many people hate Java," particularly among X users. I'm not surprised by this controversy, especially since there are still people in schools claiming that "C language is outdated, and no one needs to learn it anymore."

Personally, I haven't worked on Java projects but have some understanding of the language. I also have some biases against Java, probably because I rarely see independent developers using it. In my work, whenever Java is an option, I usually go for alternatives: Kotlin or Flutter for Android development, and Python or Node.js for backend development.

## Heavy Simplicity: Java’s Strength and Weakness  

Although I don't use Java, years of observation and reflection have helped me understand why it's so controversial. Java's success and its struggles both stem from its core identity: an industrial-grade programming language.

This identity is evident in its design and ecosystem. Some people say, "With Spring Boot, even the most inexperienced developers can produce decent code." While this might sound harsh, it highlights one of Java's key traits: it provides a relatively high floor for quality, enabling projects to utilize cheaper labor while maintaining a baseline of acceptable code quality.

However, this is also where the problem lies. The world of computer science is vast, and programming applications are diverse. Not all scenarios require the industrial-level stability and structure Java offers. Sometimes, we need rapid prototyping; other times, extreme performance or elegant functional programming. Java chose to specialize in engineering robustness, which comes at the cost of flexibility in other areas.

Developers proficient in multiple languages can often master Java with ease, appreciating its design choices with a more inclusive mindset. On the other hand, those who focus solely on Java may struggle to understand or value the strengths of other languages.

Java is indeed a "heavy sword"—clunky but powerful. Yet in the fast-paced world of technology, this characteristic is both an asset and a liability. Emerging languages bring modern features and new ways of thinking, while Java, burdened by its design philosophy and legacy, often lags behind in adopting innovations. The frustration with Java is less about hatred and more about disappointment in its limitations.

## Legacy Baggage and Modernity Debates  

Java's legacy baggage is epitomized by its slow evolution. When Java 8 introduced Lambda expressions and Stream APIs in 2014, developers were thrilled—only to soon ask why it took so long for Java to adopt features other languages had for years.

Java’s conservatism has its reasons. As a language serving primarily enterprise applications, stability and backward compatibility are paramount. For instance, in a project I participated in, we debated using new features in Java 17 but ultimately chose Java 11 for compatibility and team familiarity. Such compromises are common in enterprise development and explain Java's "conservative" image.

Java’s garbage collection (GC) mechanism, while a strength, is also a pain point. It spares developers from managing memory manually but introduces performance overhead and unpredictability. At a tech conference last year, a speaker shared how their team spent months fine-tuning JVM parameters to resolve GC issues in large-scale microservices. In contrast, languages like Go offer modern and efficient GC designs, making them more appealing for microservice development.

However, Java is making efforts to modernize. Project Loom's virtual threads, Project Valhalla's value types, and Project Amber's language enhancements show Java’s determination to meet modern programming needs. But for developers accustomed to other languages, these changes might still feel too slow.

## The Education Angle: Java in Universities vs. Industry  

As someone experiencing Java education in college, this topic resonates deeply with me. Java is often chosen for teaching due to its structured syntax, strict typing system, and exception-handling mechanisms, which foster good programming habits. Its rich libraries and documentation also make it an accessible learning tool.

However, Java education in universities is often overly theoretical and outdated. For example, modern Java tools like Spring Boot and Maven have only recently been introduced in some curricula. Many universities still rely on decade-old textbooks teaching JSP and Servlet technologies, which are now considered obsolete. Worse, focusing on a single language limits students' technological perspectives in an era of multi-paradigm, multi-language software development.

University Java education needs to shift from teaching specific syntax to fostering programming thinking. Language is just a tool—problem-solving skills are fundamental, especially in the age of AI-assisted programming.

## Performance Challenges: Java in Modern Architectures  

When discussing Java's performance, the JVM stands out as a double-edged sword. A friend once told me about deploying a Spring Boot application on a Raspberry Pi—its startup time was nearly 30 seconds. Meanwhile, a Go binary equivalent took mere seconds or even milliseconds to launch. While extreme, this example highlights Java’s limitations in certain scenarios.

JVM's memory footprint has long been an issue, exacerbated in the containerized era. For instance, a minimal Spring Boot application, even without business logic, requires over 100MB of container image size and at least 200MB of runtime memory. In contrast, a similar Go application might only use 20MB of storage and 50MB of memory. This disparity scales dramatically in microservices architecture.

## Ecosystem: Java’s Double-Edged Sword  

Java’s extensive ecosystem is both its greatest asset and its heaviest burden. Maven Central Repository hosts millions of artifacts, unmatched by most other languages. But this "richness" often becomes a liability.

Even a simple Java project on GitHub can have a `pom.xml` file stretching thousands of lines, dominated by dependency management. This reminds me of the infamous "node_modules black hole" in Node.js, but Java’s complexity can be even more daunting.

Framework choice is another double-edged sword. Spring is virtually synonymous with Java backend development. While this standardization improves efficiency and reduces communication overhead, Spring's "comprehensive" nature also creates a steep learning curve.

## Talent Market Realities  

Java’s position in the job market is unique. While it remains one of the most in-demand programming languages, pure Java developers seem increasingly less competitive. This paradox reflects market changes.

Many university graduates boast "proficiency in Java" on their resumes but lack exposure beyond Spring Boot CRUD operations. In the past, such skills might suffice, but today’s market values broader technical expertise and adaptability.

Many companies now require candidates to master at least two mainstream programming languages. This filters out candidates who rely solely on academic curricula without self-driven exploration.

## The Future of Java  

Looking ahead, Java is unlikely to disappear but may shift its focus. It will remain pivotal in enterprise systems requiring long-term maintenance but might lose ground in emerging areas like cloud-native applications and microservices to modern languages like Go and Rust.

Java’s community is actively evolving. Features like virtual threads from Project Loom and value types from Project Valhalla aim to keep Java relevant while maintaining backward compatibility. But whether these changes can keep pace with technological advancements remains to be seen.

As an independent developer, my advice is: don’t confine yourself to one language. Choose tools based on context. Java is a solid choice but not the only one. As Kent Beck once said, "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." A language is merely a tool; the key lies in solving real-world problems.

## Advice for Students: Technology Choices and Career Planning

As an undergraduate developer who has experienced the confusion of choosing the right technology, I’d like to share some personal thoughts with fellow students. Regarding whether to learn Java, my advice is: don’t focus solely on “should I learn Java?” Instead, think carefully about your career goals.

If your goal is to work in a large enterprise as a backend developer, Java is still a solid choice. While I’ve highlighted several challenges Java faces, it remains unshaken in its position within enterprise-level development, at least in the short term. Particularly in traditional industries like finance and telecommunications, Java continues to dominate. Learning Java—especially the Spring ecosystem—can give you a significant advantage when applying to jobs in these sectors.

However, if you’re aiming to become an independent developer or pursue entrepreneurship, I’d suggest focusing on lighter, more flexible technology stacks. For example, Python or Node.js have relatively gentle learning curves, allowing you to bring your ideas to life more quickly. I’ve seen independent developers build MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) with Python in no time and iterate based on market feedback. In such scenarios, Java’s heavyweight nature can be more of a hindrance than a help.

For those interested in full-stack development, I recommend starting with JavaScript/TypeScript. In modern full-stack development, JavaScript can be used for both front-end (React/Vue) and back-end (Node.js), reducing the cognitive burden of switching between languages. Once you’ve established a solid foundation, you can expand your skillset by learning Java or other languages.

If you’re drawn to low-level systems, like operating systems or databases, I suggest diving into C/C++ or Rust. These languages provide a deeper understanding of how computer systems work. In this domain, Java is rarely the optimal choice.

Finally, let me emphasize that there’s no absolute right or wrong when it comes to choosing a technology. The key lies in understanding your goals and needs. Don’t blindly chase “trendy” languages; instead, make choices that align with your circumstances and aspirations.

I hope this article offers you some insights！
